# Sustainability data visualization contest with €2000 prize pool - Deadline January 1, 2023!

Dear all-

Départ de Sentier and the ecoinvent association would like to invite submissions for an open visualization contest on sustainability data. The infoviz currently used in life cycle assessment are functional, but better visualizations could help unlock the value of our existing data and calculation results. We are looking for better visualizations of our existing databases (either as graphs or matrices), our calculation results (contribution plots, impact flow networks), or something completely new!

Please note that contest entries need to include openly licensed code in addition to the graphical outputs - we want your ideas available in software so everyone can benefit.

The ecoinvent association is sponsoring the prize fund of €2000, with the following prizes:

* First place: €1000
* Second place: €500
* Third place: €250 (2 awards)

Please see https://github.com/Depart-de-Sentier/visualization-contest-2022 for contest rules and conditions, how to enter, and for example data to get started.
